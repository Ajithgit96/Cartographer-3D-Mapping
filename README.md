* This project deals with 3D Mapping of environment with Cartographer.

* Cartographer is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor configurations. It also provides Cartographer’s ROS integration. 

* Refer to wiki page of the project for detailed explanation on establishing connection with LiDAR, visualzing point clouds and 3D Mapping with Cartographer.

* Note: All the content of the cartographer could not be uploaded into this repository, as cartographer project has sub projects (cartographer, cartographer_ros) which will be empty. But all the files created and in which the changes were made are present in this repository. Hence it is suggested to follow cartographer installation instructions from the below link and use this repository as reference.

* .lua Configuration files, launch files and urdf configuration files can be found in ‘install_isolated/share/cartographer_ros'
